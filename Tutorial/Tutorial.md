# Introduction

In the following, we will learn how to use NEMO package (Leonardo Evaristo de Sousa and Piotr de Silva, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2021 17 (9), 5816-5824 DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00476)

This step by step tutorial will use the example of Heptazine (Hz)
Firsr, one will need to compute the frequencies of the optimized structures at the S0, S1, and T1 states using **QChem** ot **Gaussian**
Then, an ensemble of geometries will be created using the **NEMO** package.

Finally, one will visualize the results using nemoview.

# Installation of the NEMO package

Run:

`pip install nemophoto`

To get the latest commit, run:

`pip install git+https://github.com/LeonardoESousa/NEMO`

Alternatively, clone the repository to your computer. Inside the NEMO folder, run:

`pip install .`

Once installed, you should be able to run the program from any folder by just using the `nemo` command.

# Ground-state optimization

**NEMO** is interfaced with QChem, but it also accepts Gaussian frequency calculations as input.

Here is an example of optimization and frequencies calculation of the ground state of the molecule using qchem. The inputfile is **Hz_optfreqS0.com** and the outputfile is **Hz_optfreqS0.out**

If an imaginary frequency is found, the molecule is unstable and the following computations might be erronous. Hence, a strategy is to tighten the convergence criteria and re-run the calculation. Or rerun the optimization from the saddle point.

Once the optimization and the frequencies are computed, it is time to generate the ensemble.

## Generating the Ensemble

We start by creating a folder and pasting the file *Hz_optfreqS0.out* in it. Let's name the folder **EnsembleS0**
Now go to the **EnsembleS0** folder and run the `nemo` command
    
```
        cd EnsembleS0
        nemo

```

The following menu will show up in the screen. Select the first option *Generate the inputs for the nuclear ensemble calculation* and follow the instructions.

```
[EnsembleS0]$ nemo
#     # ####### #     # #######

```

The folder **Geometries** is generated with all the geometries required. These are generated according to the molecule's vibrational modes. 
In addition to the folder **Geometries**, the file Magnitudes_300K_.lx is generated. It contains the magnitudes of the displacements along the vibrational modes and allows for an ensemble to me rebuilt.

Check if the input file **Geometry-1-.com** looks like :

```
[EnsembleS0]$ cat Geometries/Geometry-1-.com

## Run the ensemble calculation

The next step is running all the inidividual calculations in the ensemble. This can be done by whatever method. However, **NEMO** comes with a built in batch scheme. Usage will vary depending on the user's queue system. Here we present an example for use with slurm:  

First, one needs to create the submission script, which we call here **~/nemo.sh** . The following is an example that loads the appropriate modules. The essential line is the ```bash $1``` line.   

```#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --mem=100GB
#SBATCH --time=1-0
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 24
#SBATCH --partition=xeon24
module purge
module use /home/energy/modules/modules/all
module --ignore-cache load "binutils/2.31.1-GCCcore-8.2.0"
module load iomkl
module load QChem/5.2-multicore
export $QCLOCALSCR=/scratch/lajour
bash $1
rm -rf /scratch/lajour/*
rm slurm*out 
```

Then, one needs to create the **batch.sh** file in the **EnsembleS0** directory. Assuming the **nemo.sh** file is in the user's home directory, this can be done as:

```
        echo "sbatch ~/nemo.sh \$1" >> EnsembleS0/batch.sh
```

The file structure should look like the following :

```    
    EnsembleS0
    ├── batch.sh
    └── Hz_optfreqS0.out
    └── Geometries
```

Now, to run the ensemble calculation, run the `nemo` command and select he second option:

```
[EnsembleS0]$ nemo
#     # ####### #     # #######
##    # #       ##   ## #     #
# #   # #       # # # # #     #
#  #  # #####   #  #  # #     #
#   # # #       #     # #     #
#    ## #       #     # #     #
#     # ####### #     # #######
----------Photophysics---------

Choose your option:

ENSEMBLE SETUP:
        1 - Generate the inputs for the nuclear ensemble calculation
        2 - Run the ensemble calculations
        3 - Check the progress of the calculations
        4 - Abort my calculations (deletes the limit.lx file in the folder you are. This stops the submission of further jobs. It does not kill jobs already on the queue)
ABSORPTION:
        5 - Generate the absorption spectrum
EXCITED STATE PROPERTIES (FLUORESCENCE, PHOSPHORESCENCE, ISC):
        6 - Estimate rates and compute emission spectrum
ENSEMBLE DATA:
        7 - Gather ensemble data only
EXCITON ANALYSIS:
        8 - Estimate Förster radius, fluorescence lifetime and exciton diffusion lengths
2 # Run the ensemble calculations


batch.sh
Is this the batch script? file? y ou n?
y
Maximum number of batches to be submitted simultaneously?
10 # Number of jobs in the queue at one time
Number of processors for each individual job
12 # Depends on the partition uses: The multiplication with the “ jobs in each batch has to be equal to the number of processors in the partition
Number of jobs in each batch. Here, 24 processors were available, so 2 job were run simultaneously with 12 procs each
2 # Number of jobs in each batch file

```
If everything is set correctly, all calculations in the Geometries folder will be run. You may check the progress of the calculations by running the `nemo` command from the EnsembleS0 folder and choosing option 3. It should look as follows:

```
#     # ####### #     # #######
##    # #       ##   ## #     #
# #   # #       # # # # #     #

There are 283 successfully completed calculations out of 500 inputs
There are 3 failed jobs. If you used option 2, check the nohup.out file for details.
57.2 % of the calculations have been run.
```

Failed jobs may require extra keywords increasing, for instance, the number of SCF cycles. 


# Excited state optimization

## Generating the ensemble

One needs to create the **EnsembleS1** (**EnsembleT1**) directory and to paste the file *Hz_optfreqS1.out* (*Hz_optfreqT1.out*)in it.

Then, one needs to create the **nemo.sh** file in the **EnsembleS1** (**EnsembleT1**)  directory. This can be done by running the following cell.

```
        mkdir EnsembleS1/
        cp Hz_optfreqS1.out EnsembleS1/
        echo "sbatch ~/nemo.sh \$1" >> EnsembleS1/batch.sh
```
 or
```
        mkdir EnsembleT1/
        cp Hz_optfreqS1.out EnsembleT1/
        echo "sbatch ~/nemo.sh \$1" >> EnsembleT1/batch.sh       
```

The folder structure should look like the following :

```    
    EnsembleS1
    ├── batch.sh
    └── Hz_optfreqS1.out
or    
    EnsembleT1
    ├── batch.sh
    └── Hz_optfreqT1.out
```

Finally, go to the **EnsembleS1** (**EnsembleT1**) folder and generate the ensemble with the following steps using the `nemo` command with the first option *Generate the inputs for the nuclear ensemble calculation*
    
```    
        cd EnsembleS1
        nemo
```

Differently from the ground-state ensemble, for the question "Prepare input for absorption or fluorescence spectrum only? (y or n)" press "n". This will enable the calculation of spin-orbit couplings necessary for ISC and phosphorescence calculations.       

```

# Obtaining results

Once all calculations are run, there are basically two options to get results. The first is generating files with the spectra and rates. The second is using a separate  visualization tool called [Nemoview](https://github.com/LeonardoESousa/nemoview).

For the first method, there are two cases:

1. For absorption spectrum simulations:
    - Run the `nemo` command and choose option 5. Follow the instructions to set the parameters and the spectrum will be generated. 

2 . For photophysical rates:
    - Run the `nemo` command and choose option 6. Follow the instructions to set the parameters. Three files will be generated: an Ensemble file, with data from the ensemble of geometries; a differential_rate file, with the emission spectrum; a rates file, with all available rates (-> denote radiative transitions and ~> denote ISC transitions).

For the second method, which is the one we recommend, the first step is running the `nemo` command with option 7 (Gather ensemble data only) of nemo

```
    cd EnsembleS0
    nemo
```

choose option 7 and S0 state. 

The file Ensemble_S0_.lx is generated
Do the same for the S1 and T1 states and the files Ensemble_S1_.lx and Ensemble_T1_.lx are generated.

```
[EnsembleS0]$ nemo

----------Photophysics---------

Choose your option:

ENSEMBLE SETUP:
        1 - Generate the inputs for the nuclear ensemble calculation
        2 - Run the ensemble calculations
        3 - Check the progress of the calculations
        4 - Abort my calculations (deletes the limit.lx file in the folder you are. This stops the submission of further jobs. It does not kill jobs already on the queue)
ABSORPTION:
        5 - Generate the absorption spectrum
EXCITED STATE PROPERTIES (FLUORESCENCE, PHOSPHORESCENCE, ISC):
        6 - Estimate rates and compute emission spectrum
ENSEMBLE DATA:
        7 - Gather ensemble data only
EXCITON ANALYSIS:
        8 - Estimate Förster radius, fluorescence lifetime and exciton diffusion lengths
7
What is the initial state (S0, S1, T1, S2 ...)? Accepts comma separated values Ex: T1,T2
S0 # I visualize the results obtianed from the ground-state geometry
```

Copy the files **Ensemble_S0_.lx**, **Ensemble_S1_.lx**, **Ensemble_T1_.lx** to your work directory on your computer and follow the tutorial on the [Nemoview](https://github.com/LeonardoESousa/nemoview) page.
